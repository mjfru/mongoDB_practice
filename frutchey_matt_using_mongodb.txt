Create a database called 'my_first_db':
use my_first_db
switched to db my_first_db

Create students collection:

Create 5 students with the appropriate info:
db.students.insertOne({name: "Matt", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 7, birthday: {month: 2, day: 1, year: 1991}})
db.students.insertOne({name: "Jim", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 2, birthday: {month: 11, day: 14, year: 1990}})
db.students.insertOne({name: "Kelsey", home_state: "Washington", lucky_number: 9, birthday: {month: 2, day: 28, year: 1991}})
db.students.insertOne({name: "Scott", home_state: "California", lucky_number: 1, birthday: {month: 2, day: 2, year: 1991}})
db.students.insertOne({name: "Austin", home_state: "Washington", lucky_number: 12, birthday: {month: 3, day: 13, year: 1991}})

Get all students:
db.students.find()

Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo):
db.students.find({home_state: "California"})

Get all students whose lucky number is greater than 3:
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt: 3}})

Get all students whose lucky number is less than or equal to 10:
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte: 10}})

Get all students whose lucky number is between 1 and 9 (inclusive):
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gte: 1, $lte: 9}})


Add a field named 'interests' to all student documents in the collection. The field should be an array and contain the following entries: 'coding', 'brunch', MongoDB'. Add this field to all documents using a single command:
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {interests: ['coding', 'brunch', 'mongoDB']}})

Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays:
db.students.updateOne({name: "Matt"}, {$push: {interests: 'gaming'}})
db.students.updateOne({name: "Austin"}, {$push: {interests: 'Java'}})
db.students.updateOne({name: "Kelsey"}, {$push: {interests: 'Cooking'}})
db.students.updateOne({name: "Scott"}, {$push: {interests: 'country music'}})
db.students.updateOne({name: "Jim"}, {$push: {interests: 'hiking'}})


Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array:
db.students.updateOne({name: "Scott"}, {$push: {interests: 'taxes'}})

Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added:
db.students.updateOne({name: "Scott"}, {$pull: {interests: 'taxes'}})

Remove all students who are from California:
db.students.deleteMany({home_state: "California"})

Remove a student by name:
db.students.remove({name: "Kelsey"})

Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE):
db.students.remove({lucky_number: {$gt: 5}}, true)

Add a field to each student document called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0:
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {number_of_belts: 0}})

Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo):
db.students.updateMany({home_state: "Washington"}, {$set: {number_of_belts: 1}})

Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned':
db.students.updateMany({}, {$rename: {'number_of_belts' : 'belts_earned'}})

Remove the 'lucky_number' field:
db.students.updateMany({}, {$unset: {'lucky_number': 1 }})

Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date:
db.students.updateMany({}, {$set: {updated_on: Date()}})
